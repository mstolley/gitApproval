# Features
This extension will show the number of approvals a pull request has,
and it will turn the pull request green when it has gotten 2 :+1:.

**NOTE:** This will only now work for approvals, not a simple thumbs-up.

### To do:
1. Use github approvals API once out of beta.

# Installation

To install go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and select `Developer Mode` at the top left of the screen.

Click `Load unpacked extension` and point to the folder where you cloned this repository.
